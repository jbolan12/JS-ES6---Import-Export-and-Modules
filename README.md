# React Pi Calculation Demo

This project is a simple React app that demonstrates how to import and use modules. The app displays the value of pi, its double, and its triple using functions exported from a `math.js` module.

## Features

- **Module Import**: Demonstrates two ways of importing modules in JavaScript:
  - Named imports for individual functions.
  - Using `* as alias` for importing all exports from a module.
- **Reusable Functions**: `doublePi` and `triplePi` functions are reusable and calculate values based on pi.
